I studied web design from 1997 to 1999 and built websites before we even had the internet installed in the collage. I got my first job in tech in 1999 working with Dreamweaver and floppy disks. But the web was pretty boring back then so I left to be a hotel entertainer on a stage in Mallorca. As this was only seasonal work I spent my winters traveling, working in ski resorts, studying and building flash websites for various bars and restaurants.

In 2007 I worked for an online shop and travel agent where I was responsible for the content and graphics, newsletter designs, banners and programming of landing pages. This was my first big tech job since 1999. Unfortunately this start up ran out of money after almost 2 years and I was out of a job.

From 2009 to 2013 I studied with O’Reilly school of Technology taking on various online courses from PHP to JavaScript. But I failed to complete these courses and really learn the fundamentals of JavaScript. Back then there was no chat or videos so finding out you were missing a semi colon was over email and could take a few days to get an answer.

In 2010 I studied a TEFL, Teach English as a Foreign Language, course and then began to work as an English teacher in a language school. I setup my own web design business on the side creating websites mainly in Wordpress for various clients from a travel agent website, online shops, sports clubs websites, various company websites, restaurant websites and a restaurant Guide. I was also the main developer for Wordpress based websites for the Irish Government and Local Enterprise Offices.

In 2012 I worked for just over a year for a company called SpeedWork, where I built various different websites with Wordpress and was responsible for data process, data entry and data scraping.

In 2014 I worked for the the iProperty company an AirBnB type company but for buying and selling houses. I worked as a Frontend developer on and off for almost 3 years working with HTML and CSS as Frameworks weren’t really a thing yet and JavaScript was done by what we then called programmers. Once all HTML and CSS was done it would be passed on to a programmer to add interactivity. I also worked on converting the site to the new branding and on the architecture of the site migrating from CSS to Sass (CSS Variables didn’t yet exist) and adding Flex which was very new as well as making the site responsive.

In 2016 I decided to do a Post Graduate in Spanish language as I wanted to have job security and the tech industry was not really providing me with. I decided to study so I could get a degree and work as a language teacher in the main stream schools instead of in the language schools.

In 2017 I went back to full time education to finally master JavaScript and become a real Frontend developer. I studied a Frontend Tech degree with OpenClassrooms for 9 months as well as a Full Stack Tech degree with Treehouse learning not just JavaScript but also Node, testing, databases and I created many projects using JavaScript including games and a restaurant review site built in Node.js.

Towards the end of my studies I worked for the Good Robot as a Frontend developer for a few months where I built a node.js server with express and middleware and created a mongoose database.

I then went on to work for Bluekiri part of the Logitravel group for a year where I worked on the analysis, selection, adoption and integration of new technologies and maintenance of current tech. Along with a small team I developed and architected solutions for each client’s needs, ensured quality and good practices of generated code as well as the implementation of a solid, modular and scalable architecture. I mentored a team of several front-end developers and was part of the team who designed, architected and built a custom frontend framework. I also studied to become Microsoft certified in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3.

From 2018 to 2020 I worked as a Frontend Tech Lead where I led a team of Frontend Developers on various projects and tech stacks including Vue and Angular. I Gave workshops to various clients and worked on large scale projects as a tech lead for Barcelo hotels, Piñero hotels, Melia hotels and Camper Shoes making sure best practices were met and that sites were as performant as possible.

During this time I also mentored students on the Frontend Developer path for OpenClassrooms taking them through each project step by step with weekly video mentoring calls for code reviews and pointing them in the right direction as well as general encouragement which is always needed when learning to code. I also worked as a slack moderator and project reviewer for Treehouse, an online tech degree program. My duties included reviewing and grading of student project submissions for the Full Stack Tech Degree. Moderating multiple slack project channels. Assist students with trouble shooting and debugging web projects.

In December 2019 I became a Google Developer Expert in web Technologies and in January 2020 a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies. Later that year I also became a GitHub Star. GitHub Stars are experts and technical leaders who passionately share their knowledge, online and in-person, with communities in which they live and work.

In 2020 I worked as an Advocate for the Nuxt framework working on docs, creating examples and videos, speaking at conferences and on podcasts and building the community. I created the Ambassadors program to help others advocate for Nuxt as well as managed the open source docs site.

In 2021 I worked as an Advocate for Bit, a Component Driven Development tool, building within the product as well as creating demos, giving conference talks, podcasts, creating video material, improving documentation and reaching out to the community. Demos included an e-commerce store built from components in React and TypeScript.

I now work as a Senior Program Manger on the Developer Division team advocating for Playwright e2e testing. Giving talks on testing, working on the documentation site for Playwright. Building the Playwright community and ambassadors program and much more.
